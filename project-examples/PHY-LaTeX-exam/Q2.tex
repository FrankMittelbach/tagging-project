\item For Question 2, only one input file is used and contains all commands for the different parts and subparts. 

This is part (a), which again has an eqation. Show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = \ldots \mtag{40}
  \end{equation*}
\item Part (b) is entirely explained by text. \mmark{20}

\item Part (c) requires both inline equations $T=\ldots$ and some equations asking the student to show that
  \qqitemsbegin
  \item This equation
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = \ldots,
    \end{equation*}
    \vspace{-12pt}
  \item And also these simulataneous equations
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{dp}{dt} = \ldots, \qquad \frac{dq}{dt} = \ldots.
    \end{equation*}
