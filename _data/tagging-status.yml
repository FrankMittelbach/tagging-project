   type: package
   status: partially-supported
   comments: See comments in [[1]](#ref1). The package itself can't be loaded right now. However, the tagging code supports (most of) the document-level  syntax of `enumitem`, so that one cae use, for example, `\begin{itemize}[...]` out of the box.
   tasks: Check which keys are not yet supported and what else is missing.

   comments: >
     Rather than
     `\includegraphics[whatever]{whatever}`
     one should now write
     `\includegraphics[whatever,alt={This is the alternative text.}]{whatever}`
     The alternative text will be ignored if tagging is not used. See comments in [[1]](#ref1). It seems that draft mode doesn’t work at present.
     An old issue with height appears to be fixed.
