Issues related to the tagging project

<https://www.latex-project.org/publications/indexbytopic/pdf/>

This repository does not contain any code.

It is meant to track issues and suggestions related to the "LaTeX Tagged PDF" 
project. The code for this project is split over several other repositories 
(latex2e, latex3, tagpdf,... to name a few) and so this here is a convenient 
place to  keep any more general topics or issues that cut across the 
different repositories in a single place. 

If an issue recorded here requires changes in the other repositories 
sub-issues can then be opened (by us) in those repositories and linked back, 
or, if such changes are confined to a single repository, the issue could be 
transferred there -- whatever is more appropriate.
